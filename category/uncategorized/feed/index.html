<p>I am sure that you all have heard the buzz word <span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">&#8220;IoT&#8221;</span> an abbreviation for <span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">internet of things</span>. Or you might have seen people controlling their home and work appliances from their mobile phones. You might have seen garage doors, the gates automatically open, when a car reaches them. Yeah, that&#8217;s basically what IoT is.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an interconnected network of things or stuffs you use in your daily life. For example, imagine your light bulb, your fan and almost everything electronic connected to the internet. They can be controlled wirelessly from any corner in the world, yes, the world, you will need an internet connection though.</p>



<h2>So, is Blynk another app to control stuffs using the internet?</h2>



<p>Well, the answer to that is both yes and a no, you&#8217;ll see why, Just go on reading. </p>



<p>Blynk is a complete platform for the IoT. They have app to control things, they have servers that relays the signals and commands to and fro the edge device and the mobile devices as well. They provide us with APIs, another abbreviation which stands for Application Programming Interface. They provide us with different protocols like HTTP, MQTT, HTTPS which is more secure and many more. Making the Blynk platform accessible from many devices which support many different programming languages.</p>



<p>You could use Python, C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, and many more to control. </p>



<p>And most importantly, Blynk is Open Source. Open Source software have an amazing community support, just like Linux and android. Their source codes are available on GitHub, and so does their documentation as well. Indeed it simple to follow.</p>
