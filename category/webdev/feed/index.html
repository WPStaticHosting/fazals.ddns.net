										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Have you been searching for a <strong>domain name </strong>for your website that <strong>costs nothing</strong>? Have you ever got it and had to pay for it later? <br>Getting a free domain name for your free website is not an easy task. I have had a tough time searching for ways to get free domain name for my website. If you ask me, I would say it&#8217;s rather impossible to get a free domain, unless you have some kind of a coupon or free a give away. You cannot, ever get a free domain name for your website. </p>





<h4><strong>But I have seen people using free domains.</strong></h4>



<p>Well, what you have seen are not free domains but are <strong>free subdomains</strong>. Now, a subdomain is a part of a larger domain. Take the example of this website <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">fazals.ddns.net</span>. Here the root domain is <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">ddns.net</span> which remains the sole property of its owner and is called the top level domain. However, the prefix to the domain, here <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">fazals</span><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">,</span> defines a subdomain. </p>



<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Subdomains could or couldn&#8217;t be free, even if they are free, they <span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">might</span> have &#8220;some restrictions&#8221;.</p>


<div id="rank-math-faq" class="rank-math-block">
<div class="rank-math-list ">
<div id="faq-question-5ec976ef0ca3a" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What kind of restrictions on a free subdomain?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Well, most of the free subdomain providers restrict the use of subdomain to only A or AAAA type. Meaning that they can only be used to point to an IP address, be it IPv4 or IPv6.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-5ec976ef0ca3c" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">Can I create any number of subdomains?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Well, this is the second restriction you will usually have. The domain providers restrict the number of subdomains you can use. For example No-IP restricts you to use only 3 subdomains at any time. FreeDNS allows a maximum of 5. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-5ec976ef0ca3d" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">Are free subdomains worth it?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Well they are free, so definitely, they are worth it. You are using something for which others have already paid. <br />Who?<br />The owners of the root or the top level domain.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>




<h4>That&#8217;s enough answering questions, lets jump on to how you can get one.</h4>



<p>There are number of domain name providers that will offer you a<strong> free domain name</strong>. Yes, domain and not subdomain, but only when you purchase a hosting plan which is quite expensive. Well at least for me.</p>



<h3>A few most famous web hosting and domain name providers</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/Y7gqm" class="rank-math-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a></li><li><a href="http://www.godaddy.com/" class="rank-math-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoDaddy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/" class="rank-math-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hostgator</a></li></ul>



<a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/2327898/386517/5618" id="386517" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5618-386517" border="0" alt="Bulletproof your Domain for $4.88 a year!" width="728" height="90"></a><img loading="lazy" height="0" width="0" src="//namecheap.pxf.io/i/2327898/386517/5618" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" alt="namecheap promo">



<p>Luckily, there are many <strong>free subdomain providers</strong> that actually provide subdomain for free. And yes, they have some restrictions, but they can definitely be ignored when compared to what is being provided. </p>



<p><a href="https://fazals.ddns.net/create-your-website-for-free/" class="rank-math-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a website for free and that too without coding</a>, fascinating right? Check it out.</p>



<h3>Free <strong>subdomain </strong>providers</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.noip.com/" class="rank-math-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-IP</a></li><li><a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/" class="rank-math-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeDNS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cloudns.net/" class="rank-math-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClouDNS</a><br>and many more. </li></ul>



<p>I personally prefer using No-IP and FreeDNS as they are a little more versatile and provide fast updates. You can literally use any of them.</p>



<p>No-IP and FreeDNS also provide Dynamic DNS clients so that you will be able to use them of self hosted website whose ip address keeps on changing.</p>





<h3>Whats Dynamic DNS and why should I use it?</h3>



<p>Have you ever noticed that your <strong>ip address</strong> on your mobile and broadband network<strong> keep changing</strong>?<br>If yes, then your ip address is dynamic, and not static. Imagine you have a dynamic ip address allocated, the one which keeps changing and you are hosting a website. You setup a domain name to point toward that ip address. </p>



<p>For time being, you are able to access the website. Then, your ip address has suddenly changed. You can no longer access your website. You need to manually change the domain-ip mapping. Instead of doing it manually, the Dynamic DNS or the DDNS clients that run either on the router or on any other computer on your network update the domain-ip mapping automatically whenever a change in ip is detected.</p>





<p>So that&#8217;s how you get a free domain name. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s easy and the most economically efficient way of getting a domain name. </p>

<p>Ever wanted to create website for free? Has creating your website for free always been so tough and confusing thing to you? Or has it been too expensive to hire a web designer to maintain your website? All of your problem regarding creating your website for free can be solved, just follow along and you should be good to go.</p>



<p>At the end of this article, you should be able to get your website up and running on your local machine, something people call self hosted websites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also set up a website on a web host for free, but has certain limitations as its free.</p>



<span id="more-409"></span>

</div></figure>



<p>Firstly, trust me you need not know HTML, PHP, Javascripts to create a website.</p>



<p>But, I do encourage you to learn <a rel="noopener noreferrer" class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">html from W3School</a>. If you don&#8217;t have a Linux system for this tutorial, you can <a href="https://fazals.ddns.net/linux-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Install Linux on Windows</a> to get started.We will be creating the website using an open source <strong>content management system</strong> called <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wordpre</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress" target="_blank">s</a><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">s</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There are a few requirements to start off with a self hosted website.</p>

<p>A computer running any linux operating system would work.

<p>Above all in the bucket list, will be installation of the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apache2 server</a> on your linux machine.</p>



<p>But, before running any command in any linux machine its recomended to run the <strong>apt update </strong>and the <strong>apt upgrade </strong>commands, just to ensure everything is up to date.</p>

<h2>MySQL</h2>



<p>MySQL is an OPEN SOURCE database management system. SQL stands for&nbsp;Structured Query Language.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2>The Installation</h2>



<p>Copy paste the commands below in the terminal and you would be good to go.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre>



<p>This <strong>update </strong>command updates all the apt package list that contains all the packages, and the <strong>upgrade</strong> command upgrades the packages.</p>



<p>Next command will <em>install </em>the latest version of Apache <strong>httpd </strong>server on your linux machine. the <strong>&#8220;d&#8221;</strong> in the httpd stands for <strong>daemon</strong>, meaning that it runs in the background. And thus it has no GUI.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">sudo apt install apache2 -y</code></pre>



<p>Next command is used to install all other dependencies for running the website.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">sudo apt install php php-mysql mysql-server -y</code></pre>



<p>And if you are doing it in a <strong>Raspberry PI</strong>, the package <strong>mysql-server</strong> is <strong>discontinued</strong>. Hence run the following command.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">sudo apt install php php-mysql mariadb-server -y #Only for Raspberry Pi </code></pre>



<p>At this point all of your dependencies are successfully installed. Next this in to get the wordpress files into the webserver directory.</p>



<p>Change your current working directory to webserver directory, and delete everything inside it.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">cd /var/www/html/
sudo rm -r *</code></pre>



<p>The result of the code can be seen by typing</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">ls</code></pre>



<p>As a result, you will be able to see that the directory is empty.</p>



<p>Download the compressed WordPress file and extract it. A new folder named <strong>wordpress </strong>will be created. We need to transfer the content of the foldel to the main directory, that is to webserver directory.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">sudo wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar xzf latest.tar.gz
sudo mv wordpress/* .
sudo rm -r wordpress latest.tar.gz</code></pre>



<p>Now that the wordpress part is done. We need to create a MySQL database for wordpress to access and save information. But before that we need to make our MySQL installation secure.</p>



<h3>Securing MySQL installation</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">sudo mysql_secure_installation</code></pre>



<ul><li>You will be asked&nbsp;<code>Enter current password for root (enter for none):</code>&nbsp;— press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>. (Because the default password is blank)</li><li>Type in&nbsp;<strong>Y</strong>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>Set root password?</code>.</li><li>Type in a password at the&nbsp;<code>New password:</code>&nbsp;prompt, and press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp;<br><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;remember this root password, as you will need it later to set up WordPress.</li><li><code>Remove anonymous users?</code>Press <strong>Y</strong> and click <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type in&nbsp;<strong>Y</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>Disallow root login remotely</code>.</li><li>Type in&nbsp;<strong>Y</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>Remove test database and access to it</code>.</li><li>For <code>Reload privilege tables now</code> do the same. <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>When complete, you will be able see the message&nbsp;<code>All done!</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Thanks for using MariaDB!</code>.</p>



<h3>Create a WordPress Database</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">sudo mysql -uroot -p</code></pre>



<p>Enter the root password you created earlier.</p>



<p>at the&nbsp;<code>MariaDB [(none)]&gt;</code>&nbsp;prompt</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="sql" class="language-sql">create database wordpress;</code></pre>



<p>You must get an output response as :</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="sql" class="language-sql">Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="sql" class="language-sql">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOURPASSWORD';</code></pre>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="sql" class="language-sql">FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</code></pre>



<p>This completes your database setup. All you need to do now is to configure wordpress to access the database.</p>



<p>If you have installed the LAMP Stack in your own computer and not any other device, got to <a href="http://localhost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost</a> else you need to type the IP Address of the computer in your URL / Address Bar.</p>



<p>You should be able to see a page like this on your web browser.</p>
