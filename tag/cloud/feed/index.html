<p>So the first question I&#8217;m going to answer is <strong>what is cloud?</strong> So before I answer that question specifically, let&#8217;s cover a little bit of history. </p>



<span id="more-790"></span>



<h2>The history behind cloud</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m going to go through three different stages of <strong>how companies and people use computers</strong>.  And then we&#8217;re going get into what cloud actually is.</p>



<p>So first of all, we&#8217;re gonna look into the world as we used to know it.Whice is, when companies were in the <strong>on premise</strong> world, so basically this is back in the day.</p>



<p>let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m a startup and I&#8217;m spinning up the newest social media website, let&#8217;s call it like facenotebook.com or something like that. And I have five users at that point. I have one server sitting in my closet and I have one person just managing that server. Everything&#8217;s fine because I only have five users. <br>The next day though, word spreads and I have a thousand users, and then my website keeps crashing, why is that happening ? Does anyone know the answer?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s because I only have one server and, one server is not capable of handling that heavy traffic. So I have to do something called as <strong>scaling</strong>. And nowadays if we think about scaling, that&#8217;s another buzz word that startups love to use. But back in the days scaling was this. I had to go to a store, buy a brand new computer, put it on top of the other computer in my closet. Download code on that, do a bunch of other stuff to add it to my network. And then it could handle a thousand users and that took almost an entire day. That was a huge headache. </p>



<p>And so, this was just that&#8217;s basically one of the things that led to cloud.</p>



<h2>What’s time sharing?</h2>



<p>But the pain point is what led to the thing called <strong>time sharing</strong>. So we have startups that have these computers. But the other side of the aisle, we have these huge companies think like IBM, Google, and they have a lot of money they can buy gigantic sets of computers. They don&#8217;t need to guess and say,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“okay, we have a thousand users today, and what if I have a million tomorrow and then we are going to buy that many computers to basically manage that traffic.”</p></blockquote>



<p>IBM and Google, they could just go out and buy a million computers, right? But what if they over-budget and now they have like 200 computers that are not being used. And then one smart person says</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“hey let&#8217;s rent these out. Let&#8217;s allow other companies like these startups to rent out these computers for certain amounts of time. So that then it&#8217;s cheaper for them and we&#8217;re making passive income.”</p></blockquote>



<p>And so that&#8217;s how we got to the idea called <strong>time sharing</strong>. </p>



<h2>The emergence of “the cloud”</h2>



<p>And then this got more and more popular and it just became <strong>mainstream</strong>. It became very normal for smaller startups companies to go to large companies and rent out their computers for a certain amount of time. </p>



<p>And then, after a while these bigger companies said,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“oh! What if we can make more money off of this time sharing thing? What if we provided additional services on top of this infrastructure that we&#8217;re renting out?”</p></blockquote>



<p>And these additional services, or the suite of services that was created then is what&#8217;s called as <strong>cloud</strong>.</p>



<p>So cloud is often broken up into <strong>three </strong>different umbrellas or categories of tools. And the first set of tools is what&#8217;s known as <strong>infrastructure as a service</strong>. Infrastructure as a service is <strong>timesharing</strong>. That is if you have a computer and you are not using it all the time. So you sell it for a certain amount of time to other companies.</p>



<p>You have storage discs. You sell it, that&#8217;s infrastructure. It&#8217;s literally the hardware that you can touch and feel. So you are selling that. And then companies said &#8211;  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“what if we can add additional tooling to this infrastructure? What if we just had a tool that could handle tens of millions of users?”</p></blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s basically <strong>infrastructure with some software involved</strong> &#8211; The second set of tools.</p>



<p>And then lastly is <strong>software as a service</strong>. This is basically the tools that you know. Like <strong>Google Docs</strong> ,<strong>Drive, Slides</strong> and <strong>Sheets</strong>.</p>



<p>In conclusion cloud is a set of tools that helps developers spend less time managing and spend more time creating.</p>



<h2>And so now what is GCP? and the services it offers</h2>

<p>GCP or the Google Cloud Platform is obviously a cloud tool but it&#8217;s many things altogether. Before we get into the specifics of GCP, lets discuss Google Cloud as a whole. </p>



<h3>GCP vs G Suite</h3>



<p>Google Cloud is the mixture of both <strong>GCP </strong>and <strong>G Suite</strong>. GCP in a basic sense is the infrastructure and platform where you can run codes, store data things like that. And then G Suite as you all probably know is things like Google Docs, Google Drive, that is the software as a service. G Suite also has a ton of APIs that you can use to enhance the GCP user experience.</p>



<p>So, on GCP you can do a lot of things. First of all, you can <strong>run a virtual machine</strong> and you can literally run a giant script that&#8217;ll take a week. Instead of running it on your own computer and worrying about the battery dying, and this and that. You can just put it on a virtual machine in the cloud. Or, you can deploy a web application and have the code run on cloud.</p>



<h3>Services</h3>



<p>You can store data on the <strong>SQL databases</strong> and the <strong>NoSQL databases</strong>. There are tools for <strong>networking</strong>, and <strong>monitoring</strong>. So let&#8217;s say you have all these tools in your cloud and you want to monitor how they&#8217;re working. For instance, if one thing crashes, you can see why that happened.</p>



<p>There are tools like <strong>IoT. Core</strong> that can help you build internet of things projects. There are tools to build your own API, its called <strong>Apairy</strong>. There are some open source tools like <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. It&#8217;s a machine learning platform, totally open source, many other software companies and developers use it as well.</p>
